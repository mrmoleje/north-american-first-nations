# Massacres of first nation peoples: 1500-1700

A shiny app for massacres that took place in North America (USA and Canada) between 1500 and 1700.

Run the app ['here'](https://mrmoleje.shinyapps.io/north-america-massacres/) 

This map can be used to gain insight into the massacres that took place in north america within the given time frame, as well as understanding which tribe was under attack and how many died.

The inspiration for this map comes from the book ['An Inconvenient Indian'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inconvenient-Indian-Curious-Account-America/dp/0816689768) by Thomas King, who describes European colonialism towards native people as a condition much like malaria:

"Malaria, in case you've fotgotten, is an infectious disease that sickens and kills millions of people every year. It's a remarkable disease. Like colonialism, it can lie dormant for years. And it can flare up at any moment".

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo by typing the following into the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/mrmoleje/north-american-first-nations.git 
```
### Prerequisites

In order to run the map you'll need R Studio installed, as well as the following libraries (shiny, leaflet, dplyr, htmltools, readxl).

## Data

These data were collected by myself through internet research and are by no means a full representation of all massacres that look place between 1500 and 1700.

[It has been estimated that the first nations population was more than halved with the introduction of American settlers post Columbus](https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/massive-native-population-decline-after-columbus-arrives/) 

## Built With

* [Rshiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
* [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
